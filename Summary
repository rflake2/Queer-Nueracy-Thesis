USRP grant Mason Impact project  tilted Estimating the Size of the LGBTQ/Queer Population Through the Average American: The Impact of Proximity which is concerned with what queer proximal factors impact queer numeracy. I programmed an original survey instrument in Qualtrics and collected nearly 1,000 responses from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data was adjudicated, cleaned, and recoded in r and analyzed with an ordinal logistical regression. Results indicate that queer media has no statistically significant relation to queer numeracy while queer interpersonal relationships was statistically significant (p < .001).
